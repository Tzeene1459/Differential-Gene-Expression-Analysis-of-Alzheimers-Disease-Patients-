# Alzheimer's Disease Gene Expression Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes gene expression data from patients at different stages of Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective is to identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed between different disease stages using a T-test. The final results include lists of significantly altered genes and pathway enrichment analysis to understand biological processes relevant to Alzheimer's progression.

## Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to compare gene expression data across different disease stages:
- **Incipient vs. Moderate Group:** Comparing gene expression data for patients in the incipient stage against those in the moderate stage.
- **Moderate vs. Severe Group:** Comparing gene expression data for patients in the moderate stage against those in the severe stage.

A T-test is used to determine whether the mean gene expression values significantly differ between the baseline and comparison groups. For the first comparison (Incipient vs Moderate) I am using Incipient as my baseline group and Moderate as my comparison group. For the second comparison, I am using the Moderate group as my baseline group and Severe as my comparison group. 

In theory, the t-test will essentially help me either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, which in this case would be that both groups (base and comparison) have the same mean, meaning that there is no difference in terms of gene expression between the group of patients in the baseline and comparison groups of each analysis. 

The significantly altered genes are then used for downstream enrichment analysis to identify relevant biological pathways.


## Vision: 
With the short list of pathways at hand, I should be able to do a domain-level research on those pathways to figure out if something can be a significant contribution for understanding of the disease, or that may eventually lead to better treatment possibilities. 

## Methodology
The analysis follows these main steps:

1. **Data Validation & Preprocessing**
   - Ensure correct structure (patients as rows, genes as columns)
   - Identify and subset patient groups based on `DISEASE_STATUS`
   - Normalize and format gene expression data

2. **T-Test Analysis**
   - Prepare matched subsets of clinical and gene expression data
   - Define baseline and comparison groups
   - Run T-tests using `fnTTest.R`
   - Identify genes with significant differential expression (p â‰¤ 0.01)

3. **Result Analysis & Enrichment Analysis**
   - Extract top 20 significantly altered genes
   - Perform pathway enrichment analysis using EnrichR database and package in R
   - Save results in CSV and multi-tab Excel formats
   - Perform exploratory domain level research on top pathways (see presentation for final findings)
